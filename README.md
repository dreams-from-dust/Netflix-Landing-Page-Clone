# Netflix Landing Page Clone

A responsive replica of the Netflix landing page, built from scratch using HTML and CSS. This project was developed to showcase a foundational understanding of modern front-end design and layout.

### Key Features

* **Responsive Layout:** The design adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes using media queries. The layout for the hero section and navigation uses Flexbox, while the footer is built with CSS Grid.
* **Hero Section:** The landing page features a hero section with a background image and a dark overlay to make the text more legible.
* **Semantic HTML:** The page is structured with HTML5 semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
* **Flexbox and CSS Grid:** The project demonstrates a strong understanding of Flexbox for alignment and spacing and CSS Grid for creating a flexible footer layout that wraps on smaller screens.
